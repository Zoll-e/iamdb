## **Overview of the project**

---

&nbsp;

> This project was made specifically for ApexLab as the test part of their selection proccess.
> In a few words this application is using GraphQL to reach out to a TMDB sandbox to retrieve and display data from it.

> This was really exciting and challenging for me. I have learnt a lot about new technologies (typescript,cypress,MUI,NGINX) and deepened my knowledges about the ones that I already knew.
